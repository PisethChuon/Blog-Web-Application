# Blog Web Application

A simple blog web application built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. This application allows users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts. No database is used in this version, so posts will not persist between sessions.

## Features

**Post Creation:** Users can create new blog posts.
**Post Viewing:** The home page displays all existing blog posts.
**Post Update/Delete:** Users can edit and delete their posts.
**Styling:** The application is styled for a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Requirements

**Node.js & Express.js:** The application is a web server built using Node.js and Express.js. Express.js handles routing and middleware.
**EJS:** EJS is used as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.
